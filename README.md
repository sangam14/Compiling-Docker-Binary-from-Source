# Compiling Your Own Docker Binary from Source 

## Problem 

You would like to develop the Docker software and build your own Docker binary.

## Pre-requisite

- Create an account with [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)
- Open [PWD](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) Platform on your browser 
- Click on **Add New Instance** on the left side of the screen to bring up Alpine OS instance on the right side

## Run multiple containers in an interactive and detached mode. 


# Solution 

# using just one commnad fork the docker repository from github as shown below :

```
$ git clone https://github.com/docker/docker.git
```
## you will get on screen something like this 
```

Docker is built within a Docker container. In a Docker host, you can clone the Docker repository and use the Makefile rules to build a new binary. This binary is obtained by running a privileged Docker container. The Makefile contains several targets, including a binary target:
```
cat Makefile 
```
```
# as root (or prepend with sudo)
make build 

// default: binary

// all: build
 //  $(DOCKER_RUN_DOCKER) hack/make.sh

# this takes a while and prints the output from "Docker build ." 
# It ends with: "Successfully built ..".

# as root (or prepend with sudo)
make binary

// binary: build
 // $(DOCKER_RUN_DOCKER) hack/make.sh binary

# This runs the image we created with "make build". 
# Ends with "Created binary: bundles/1.8.0-dev/binary/docker-1.8.0-dev",
# where "1.8.0-dev" is the version I'm building, 
# the next unreleased version at the time of writing.
```

## Therefore, it is as easy as sudo make binary: 

Tips :  The hack directory in the root of the Docker repository has been moved to the project directory. Therefore, the make.sh script is in fact at project/make.sh. It uses scripts for each bundle that are stored in the project/make/ directory. 
  ```
// binary: build
 // $(DOCKER_RUN_DOCKER) hack/make.sh binary
# This runs the image we created with "make build". 
# Ends with "Created binary: bundles/1.8.0-dev/binary/docker-1.8.0-dev",
# where "1.8.0-dev" is the version I'm building, 
# the next unreleased version at the time of writing.
      # as root (or prepend with sudo)
     make binary
    docker run --rm -it --privileged \
                        -e BUILDFLAGS -e DOCKER_CLIENTONLY -e DOCKER_EXECDRIVER \
                        -e DOCKER_GRAPHDRIVER -e TESTDIRS -e TESTFLAGS \
                        -e TIMEOUT \
                        -v "/tmp/docker/bundles:/go/src/github.com/docker/docker/\
                                                bundles" \
                        "docker:master" hack/make.sh binary
    ---> Making bundle: binary (in bundles/1.9.0.-dev/binary)
    Created binary: \
    /go/src/github.com/docker/docker/bundles/1.9.0-dev/binary/docker-1.9.0-dev
```

## it will take more time ..........until get something on screen like this 

![](https://github.com/sangam14/Compiling-Docker-Binary-from-Source/blob/master/pic1.png)
You see that the binary target of the Makefile will launch a privileged Docker con‚Äêtainer from the docker:master image, with a set of environment variables, a volume mount, and a call to the hack/make.sh binary command. 
With the current state of Docker development, the new binary will be located in the bundles/1.9.0-dev/binary/ directory. The version number might differ, depending on the state of Docker releases. 


## Test the new binary
Stop the old docker daemon
Stop the docker daemon so w can run our new one. On Ubuntu / debian this is:

```
service docker stop
```
On other systems it might be.. something else. You can try "killall docker" or "pkill docker"
## Start a daemon using our new binary
Start a daemon with the new binary:
```
# in the docker/ directory where we ran make build and make binary
./bundles/1.8.0-dev/binary/docker -d  # the version, "1.8.0-dev", will vary according to the version your building
 ```           
Run the old binary as a client and connect to our new daemon
With the docker server (docker -d) still running, open a new console / terminal and run: docker version. This will use the original docker as a client and it should be able to contact our new docker binary. You should see the difference in server version and client version, like so:

```
docker version

Client version: 1.6.0
Client API version: 1.18
Go version (client): go1.4.2
Git commit (client): 4749651
OS/Arch (client): linux/amd64
Server version: 1.8.0-dev
Server API version: 1.20
Go version (server): go1.4.2
Git commit (server): c2346f6
OS/Arch (server): linux/amd64
 ```           
As you can see "Client version" and "Server version" are different. This is expected since the server is the new binary we just started as a daemon (./bundles...docker -d). The client, however, is the docker installed on the system. Run "which docker" to see where this binary is located.
## Run the new binary as a client and connect to our new daemon
You can test the new binary as a client as well:
```
# in the docker/ directory where we ran make build and make binary
./bundles/1.8.0-dev/binary/docker version

Client:
 Version:      1.8.0-dev
 API version:  1.20
 Go version:   go1.4.2
 Git commit:   c2346f6
 Built:        Thu Jul 23 15:03:21 UTC 2015
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64

Server:
 Version:      1.8.0-dev
 API version:  1.20
 Go version:   go1.4.2
 Git commit:   c2346f6
 Built:        Thu Jul 23 15:03:21 UTC 2015
 OS/Arch:      linux/amd64
 ```           
As you can see the Client and Server version is now the same. Both the server and client is running the same binary file; the one we just built. Also, it looks like the output of docker version changed between version 1.6 and 1.8.

## to make this easy 
To ease this process, you can clone the repository that accompanies this cookbook. A Vagrantfile is provided that starts an Ubuntu 14.04 virtual machine, installs the latest stable Docker release, and clones the Docker repository: 
   
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/how2dock/docbook
   cd docbook/ch04/compile/
   vagrant up
    
   ```
Once the machine is up, ssh to it and go to the /tmp/docker directory, which should have been created during the Vagrant provisioning process. Then run make. The first time you run the Makefile, the stable Docker version installed on the machine will pull the base image being used by the Docker build process ubuntu:14.04, and then build the docker:master image defined in /tmp/docker/Dockerfile. This can take a bit of time the first time you do it: 
   
  ```
   $ vagrant ssh
    $ cd /tmp/docker
    $ sudo make binary
    docker build -t "docker:master" .
    Sending build context to Docker daemon 55.95 MB
    Sending build context to Docker daemon
    Step 0 : FROM ubuntu:14.04
    ..........
    ....
   ```
## Once this completes, you will have a new Docker binary: 
   ```
   $ cd bundles/1.9.0-dev/binary/docker
    $ ls
    docker  docker-1.9.0-dev  docker-1.9.0-dev.md5  docker-1.9.0-dev.sha256
   ```
